                    My name is Jesus, and I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. When I started this coding bootcamp,
                    I had little knowledge about programming, but as the course progresses, I am slowly but surely surprising myself with what I am learning.
                      It has been an exciting challenge, and I am eager to see where this new journey takes me.

                    Before diving into coding, I built my career in retail and management. 
                    I started as an hourly associate at Dicks Sporting Goods in 2017 and worked there until 2020. That year, 
                    I decided to take a different path and joined the North Carolina Highway Patrol Academy as a cadet. 
                    However, I quickly realized that it was not the right fit for me, so I left the academy and returned to Dicks Sporting Goods, 
                    this time as a manager, where I stayed until 2023. Currently, I am working as a manager in a restaurant, 
                    but I wanted something different and more fulfilling for my futureâ€”leading me to pursue a career in coding.

                    Outside of work and coding, I have a deep passion for football. I am a huge fan of the Carolina Panthers and love watching and discussing the sport. 
                    I also enjoy trying new foods, traveling to new places, and spending quality time with my family. As I move forward in this bootcamp, 
                    I am excited about the opportunities ahead and can not wait to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech.
